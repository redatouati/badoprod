    "description": "Imidiwan is a Tuareg Rockn’Blues band from tassili n'ajjer (Djanet, Illizi) in the middle of southern east algerian desert. Founded in 2013 by its leader Bendaoued Ahmed and his companions Elies Abdelkader and Mtetita Mahmoud. The band mixes between the rockn’blues musical style and the tende, a style that merges the musical environment and the saharian cultur and we can see this mix in the used instuments by the use of ancient ones (Djembe, Calebasse) and the modern ones where comes the energy of their performences. The songs of imidiwan hold the footprint of an commitment turned to the youth that expresses the peace, the harmony and the love through songs and texts poetically well written in the twareg's language called 'Tamasheq'",
